# Advanced-Object-Oriented-Programming-and-Robustness

Overview
This lab bridges the gap between abstract architectural design and professional technical execution. Students will evolve from basic scripting to Systems Design by implementing the pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Inheritance, Encapsulation, and Polymorphism, alongside robust Exception Handling.

Scenario A: The "Green-Transit" Fleet Manager 
Base Class: Vehicle (Properties: VehicleID, ModelName).
Sub-Classes: ElectricBus (Battery %) and GasPoweredVan (Fuel Level).
Logic: Implement a CalculateRange() method. The Bus calculates based on battery, the Van based on fuel.
Exception: Throw an error if the energy level is below 5% during a range check.
